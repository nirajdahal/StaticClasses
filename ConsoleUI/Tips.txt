1> Class Types

i> Static Classes
- We dont need to instantiate the classes to use static methods. We can call directly method directly using calss name.
- If we make classes static, we have to make all methods static as well
- We should try not store data in static classes beacuse the value stays for the entire lifecycle of the application
	i.e (more memory space) ex- public static int myAge;

*Prop Tip: Use Class files to seperate your code so that each class and each methods have its own purpose
